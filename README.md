# ai--prompt-project
This Python script is a text-based interactive adventure game where players make choices that shape the story's outcome. The game uses a dictionary to manage story nodes, each with a prompt and choices leading to different paths and endings. Players navigate through the story using recursive function calls, with error handling to manage invalid inputs. The game offers multiple endings like "eternal peace" or being "trapped forever", making each playthrough unique. It demonstrates key programming concepts like recursion, conditionals, and data structures.
